# Pomodoro Clock

### I wish to build a time management application, that combines simplicity and functionality, in the form of a Pomodoro Clock.

## Goals

- Make a functioning 2-stage timer. One stage for focus/work, and one stage for relaxation.

- Upon one timer's completion, The alarm will play an alert sound file, and the other timer will begin its countdown (This is to emulate an uptime/downtime of doing active work and relaxation).

- Provide the user the ability to edit the length of time for both timers, whilst leaving the default to 25 minutes for work, and 5 minutes for relaxation. Add button functionality for options to begin timer, pause, reset, etc.

- **Stretch Goal:** Maybe have the timer provide a push notification upon timer completion?

- **Stretch Goal 2:** Somehow integrate an option for environmental noise to play during timer durations a la Rainymood.

## Design Decisions

- A circular countdown timer, preferably done with Javascript

- Minimalist Design based around the circular timer.

- Use an easy on the eyes palette, while maintaining good contrast.
